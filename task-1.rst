Task 1: Quotation of the Day
============================

Before you can jump in and write your first program, you need to learn some
python ABC. This task will help you to learn some basic **variable types**
(i.e., numbers, strings and their subclasses), the IF statement, and how to
print sth. out.

What we will do is to creat a small program to print some quotation to the
screen. Its very first version looks quite stupid, but we could improve it
later on.

Below is a list of quotations, you are required to print them one by one, and
follow a specfic format::

   who?            |  said what?
   carl sagan      | Somewhile, something incredible is waiting to be know. 
   richard feynman | The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.
   issac asimov    | Am I trying to find God? Well, God is smarter than me, so let him find me.
   walt disney     | Laughter is timeless, imagination has no age, and dreams are forever.
   mahatma gandhi  | Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.
   the terminator  | I'll be back.
   lao tzu         | When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.
   jim carrey      | Good morning! And in case I don't see you: good afternoon, good evening and good night.
   issac newton    | We build too many walls and not enough bridges.
   mark twain      | It's not the size of the dog in the flight, it's the size of the fligt in the dog.

For example, after you run the script and print the first quotation, the output
should be like this::

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Quotation of the Day %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %   Somewhile, something incredible is waiting to be know.        %
    %                                                                 %
    %                                --- Carl Sagan                   %
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In some cases, the sentence is long. However, I hope you still keep it in the
box. Try to do this first.  

Then you are supposed to modify the program, making it print out some quotation
randomly! (advanced)



step 1: Reading 
---------------
read section 6 - 9.1 of A Byte of Python (http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python
, if the link is not working, you can baidu or google the keyword). Don't mess
up with the details. Aftert the reading, you should know:

 - how to make proper comments of your code
 - how to define a string variable and call it in the program 
 - how to use expressions to decide if a command should run or not
 - how to use the print command
 - how to write a python script and run it


step 2: Thinking
----------------

  The spirit of programming is to have a step-by-step task list to finish the project. 

  If you have questions, just ask!

step 3: Writing
----------------
   


For the advanced task, You should assign a number to each quotation (like, 1,
2, 3, 4), make a integar variable (e.g., names as *pick*). If *pick* equals
some number which corresponding a specific quote, then print it out.

If you can print out the quotation as shown above, let me know. I will let you
know how to make a random number generator.
