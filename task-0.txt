a) How to use githhub? 

Read through the following article and try to DIY in your computer.

Since you're using Ubuntu, step2 (install git) can be a little different:


run following command in your terminal 

     sudo apt-get install git

homework: create a repository named 'python-adventure ' in your github, push a local file named "task-0.txt", which contains everything I write in this email.
 
b) Install python

First, please run following command in your terminal

    python -V

If you have python installed, the output should be like
    Python 2.7.5 (or a different version number)

However, if it's not the case, check this page:

c)* learning vim (advanced, only do it if you have spare time. You should not get too bogged down in any advanced task like this)

It's OK to use kwrite, gedit, or any other 记事本-like program to edit a plain txt file. However, that is not what a programmer, even a bad one, would do in the long run. You may want to learn vim or emacs, which is much more productive.
